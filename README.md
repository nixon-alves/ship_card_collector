# 🚢 Sunken Ships Card Collector

A Flutter app that displays collectible cards of famous sunken ships.
Tapping on each card reveals detailed historical data like the travel route, sinking cause, number of deaths, and more.

This app was developed as part of my Flutter learning journey and showcases skills such as layout design, navigation, asset management, and JSON parsing.
